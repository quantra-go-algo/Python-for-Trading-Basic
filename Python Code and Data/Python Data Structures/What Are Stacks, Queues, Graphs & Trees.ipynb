    "\n",
    "A stack is a collection of objects which work as per the <b>LIFO - Last in First Out</b> principle. Consider a simple example: You are throwing a dinner party at your place. You will place a stack of plates at the buffet table. Whenever you are adding new plates to the stack, you will place the plates at the top. Similarly, whenever a guest takes a plate, he/she will take it from the top of the stack. This is the Last in, First Out principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add items to the stack, it is known as <b>push operation</b>. You will do this using the append ( ) method.  When you remove items from a stack, it is known as <b>pop operation</b>. You actually have a pop ( ) method in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not something new which you have learnt. But understanding how data works in a stack (LIFO principle) is important since this concept is used for evaluating expressions and syntax parsing, scheduling algorithms, routines, writing effective functions and so on."
